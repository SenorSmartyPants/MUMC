# Script
## media_cleaner.py
This script will go through all played movies, tv episodes, videos, trailers, and audio for the specified user; deleting any media past the specified played age cut off.

# Configuration
## media_cleaner_config.py
The first time you run the script it will attempt to create the config file by asking a few questions.

## Configuration Contents
#### Media will be deleted once it has been played the configured number of days ago:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Delete media type once it has been played x days ago
#   0-365000000 - number of days to wait before deleting played media
#  -1 : to disable managing specified media type
# (-1 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
not_played_age_movie=-1
not_played_age_episode=-1
not_played_age_video=-1
not_played_age_trailer=-1
not_played_age_audio=-1
```
#### When enabled, media will not be deleted if it is marked as a favorite:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Decide if media set as a favorite should be deleted
# Favoriting a series, season, or network-channel will treat all child episodes as if they are favorites
# Favoriting an artist, album-artist, or album will treat all child tracks as if they are favorites
# Similar logic applies for other media types (episodes, trailers, etc...)
#  0 : ok to delete favorite
#  1 : do no delete favorite
# (1 : default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
keep_favorites_movie=1
keep_favorites_episode=1
keep_favorites_video=1
keep_favorites_trailer=1
keep_favorites_audio=1
```
#### Additional options for determining if a media item should be considered marked as a favorite based on specified metadata item:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Advanced favorites configuration bitmask
#     Requires 'keep_favorites_*=1'
#  xxxxxxxA - keep_favorites_audio must be enabled; keep audio tracks based on if the FIRST artist listed in the track's 'artist' metadata is favorited
#  xxxxxxBx - keep_favorites_audio must be enabled; keep audio tracks based on if the FIRST artist listed in the tracks's 'album artist' metadata is favorited
#  xxxxxCxx - keep_favorites_audio must be enabled; keep audio tracks based on if the FIRST genre listed in the tracks's metadata is favorited
#  xxxxDxxx - keep_favorites_audio must be enabled; keep audio tracks based on if the FIRST genre listed in the album's metadata is favorited
#  xxxExxxx - keep_favorites_episode must be enabled; keep episode based on if the FIRST genre listed in the series' metadata is favorited
#  xxFxxxxx - keep_favorites_movie must be enabled; keep movie based on if the FIRST genre listed in the movie's metadata is favorited
#  xGxxxxxx - reserved...
#  Hxxxxxxx - reserved...
#  0 bit - disabled
#  1 bit - enabled
# (00000001 - default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
keep_favorites_advanced='00000001'
```
#### Dependent on the above "advanced options", determines if only the first metadata item should be considered or all metadata items should be considered:
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Advanced favorites any configuration bitmask
#     Requires matching bit in 'keep_favorites_advanced' bitmask is enabled
#  xxxxxxxa - xxxxxxxA must be enabled; will use ANY artists listed in the track's 'artist' metadata
#  xxxxxxbx - xxxxxxBx must be enabled; will use ANY artists listed in the track's 'album artist' metadata
#  xxxxxcxx - xxxxxCxx must be enabled; will use ANY genres listed in the track's metadata
#  xxxxdxxx - xxxxDxxx must be enabled; will use ANY genres listed in the album's metadata
#  xxxexxxx - xxxExxxx must be enabled; will use ANY genres listed in the series' metadata
#  xxfxxxxx - xxFxxxxx must be enabled; will use ANY genres listed in the movie's metadata
#  xgxxxxxx - reserved...
#  hxxxxxxx - reserved...
#  0 bit - disabled
#  1 bit - enabled
# (00000000 - default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
keep_favorites_advanced_any='00000000'
```
#### Media in these library folders will be treated as if they are all marked as a favorite (i.e. media will not be deleted):
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Whitelisting a library folder will treat all child media as if they are favorites
# ('' - default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
whitelisted_library_folders='/Path/To/Library/Folder0,/Path/To/Library/Folder1,/Path/To/Library/FolderX'
```
#### Allows the script to be run without deleting media (i.e. for testing and setup); Set to 1 when ready for "production":
```python
#----------------------------------------------------------#
# 0 - Disable the ability to delete media (dry run mode)
# 1 - Enable the ability to delete media
# (0 - default)
#----------------------------------------------------------#
remove_files=0
```
#### Created first time the script runs; Do **_NOT_** edit these:
```python
#------------DO NOT MODIFY BELOW---------------------------#

#----------------------------------------------------------#
# Server branding chosen during setup; only used during setup
#  0 - 'emby'
#  1 - 'jellyfin'
# Server URL created during setup
# Admin username chosen during setup
# Access token requested from server during setup
# User key of account to monitor played media chosen during setup
#----------------------------------------------------------#
server_brand='xyz'
server_url='http://localhost.abc:8096/basename'
admin_username='Username'
access_token='0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0'
user_key='abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789a'
DEBUG=0
```

# Usage
Make media_cleaner.py executable and run ./media_cleaner.py.  If no conifg file is found it will prompt you to create one.  Once done you can run the script again to view files that will be deleted

# Requirements
* python3
* python-dateutil

# First Run
* $ /path/to/python3.x /path/to/media_cleaner.py
* You may get the below python error if the python-dateutil module is not installed
   - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dateutil' python-dateutil
* For Ubuntu/Linux Mint type systems you can install the python-dateutil module with the following commands:
   - $ sudo apt-get update
   - $ sudo apt-get upgrade -y
   - $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
